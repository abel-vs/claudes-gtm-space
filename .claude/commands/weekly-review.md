description: End-of-week GTM review - wins, metrics, learnings, and next week plan
---

Run my weekly GTM review using the cro-manager agent.

Give me a comprehensive weekly review:

1. **This Week's Results**
   - Pipeline changes (new deals, stage movements, wins/losses)
   - KPI actuals vs targets
   - Outreach volume and response rates

2. **Wins & Highlights**
   - What went well this week
   - Deals that progressed

3. **Learnings & Blockers**
   - What didn't work
   - Obstacles encountered

4. **Next Week Plan**
   - Carry-over actions
   - New priorities based on pipeline gaps
   - Suggested outreach targets

5. **Update Pipeline Metrics**
   - Help me update the Notion Pipeline Metrics page with this week's actual numbers

Be honest about performance - if I'm behind, tell me what needs to change.
