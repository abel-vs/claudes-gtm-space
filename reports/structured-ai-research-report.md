## Company Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Company Name** | Structured AI |
| **Website** | https://getstructured.ai/ |
| **LinkedIn** | https://www.linkedin.com/company/getstructured-ai |
| **Founded** | 2025 |
| **Headquarters** | San Francisco, California, United States (with London operations) |
| **Industry** | Construction Technology / AI for AEC (Architecture, Engineering, Construction) |
| **Y Combinator** | Fall 2025 Batch (F25) |
| **Employee Count** | 3 (founding team) |

### What They Do

Structured AI is building the AI workforce for construction design engineering, starting with AI agents that perform quality control on technical documents and drawings. Their agents learn engineering standards, apply building codes, and automatically review drawings to reduce clashes, inconsistencies, and costly RFIs (Requests for Information) and change orders.

### Mission/Vision

To free engineers from repetitive administrative work and manual QA/QC tasks so they can focus on creative design work. The team aims to automate the 30-50% of engineer time currently spent on manual documentation and compliance checking.

### Core Problem Being Solved

- Engineers spend 30-50% of their time on technical documentation, reporting, and routine tasks
- Manual "spot-checking" for design errors costs the construction industry $177 billion annually
- Senior Engineers spend up to 50% of their time cross-referencing 100-page drawing sets against 2,000-page building regulations by hand
- Cross-trade coordination issues lead to expensive RFIs and change orders during construction

- Met Issy at Oxford's AI society
- Met Brandon through the society; Brandon had already spent 6 years solving problems in the construction engineering space
- Applied to Y Combinator Summer 2025 but weren't accepted
- Spent time speaking to dozens of engineers to understand the problem and build sales pipeline
- Reapplied and accepted to Y Combinator Fall 2025 batch
- Based in San Francisco during YC, working intensely (wake 4am-9am, work all day)

### Team Size & Growth

- Current: 3 employees (founders only)
- Growth stage: Pre-seed/seed, focused on product development and early customers

## Investors

### Lead Investors

**Zero Prime Ventures**
- Investment thesis: Backs "Day 0 Engineer-Founders" building enterprise startups with technical differentiation
- Focus areas: Data infrastructure, AI/ML platforms, devtools, blockchain, cloud tech
- Check size: $500k-$1.5m
- Notable portfolio: ServiceNow (IPO), Cloudera, Hightouch, plus 2 unicorns
- Fund II ($48M) emphasizes generative AI tooling
- Why they invested: Structured AI fits their thesis perfectly - deeply technical Oxford-trained founders building AI infrastructure for a specific vertical (construction)

**Oxford Seed Fund**
- Europe's largest student-led VC fund
- Invests £20k-£100k in Oxford-affiliated startups
- Why they invested: All three founders are Oxford alumni with strong track records (top of year, NeurIPS publications, etc.)

**Airtree Ventures** (involvement confirmed but exact participation unclear)
- Partner James Cameron quoted: "The only true differentiation in startups is urgency – and I've not met many teams who have as much urgency as Raymond, Isabel and Brandon. Impressed with what they've already built and excited to see what else is coming."
- Airtree is one of Australia's largest VC funds (portfolio: Canva, Go1, Employment Hero, Pet Circle, Immutable, Linktree)
- Given Raymond's Australian background, this connection makes sense

   - Build integrations they haven't (ERP systems, accounting)
   - White-label our solution for larger players
   - Integrate with project management tools they're missing

6. **Pricing & Packaging**
   - Offer more flexible pricing (usage-based, freemium)
   - Target smaller firms they can't economically serve
   - Self-service option vs enterprise-only

3. **Venture-Backed Speed**
   - $1M enables 18+ months of runway
   - Likely to raise larger round soon (Series A)
   - Could aggressively underprice to gain market share
   - Network effects if they get multiple firms using platform

4. **Technical Moat Building**
   - Proprietary vision model improves with more data
   - Learning firm-specific standards creates switching costs
   - Research background enables continuous innovation
   - Patent potential from CTO's work

5. **Market Timing Advantage**
   - First-mover in AI-native construction QA/QC

## Appendix: Key Quotes

**Raymond Zhao (CEO):**
> "I initially pursued architecture and engineering, but was talked out of the profession during an internship when junior architects warned him about extensive manual 'grunt work.' I switched to studying Maths & Stats at Oxford and now views my work freeing engineers from these tasks as a full-circle moment."

**Robert Ioanna (CTO, Syska Hennessy Group):**
> "Top 1% of professionals I've worked with, their AI solutions and proactive communication have transformed our Innovation Program."

**James Cameron (Partner, Airtree Ventures):**
> "The only true differentiation in startups is urgency – and I've not met many teams who have as much urgency as Raymond, Isabel and Brandon. Impressed with what they've already built and excited to see what else is coming."

**On the Problem:**
> "The construction industry's reliance on manual 'spot-checking' for design errors costs $177 billion annually to fix mistakes that are discovered too late. Senior Engineers spend up to 50% of their time cross-referencing 100-page drawing sets against 2,000-page building regulations by hand."
