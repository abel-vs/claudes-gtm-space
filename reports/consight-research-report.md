## People & Organization

### Founders

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: There is conflicting information that needs clarification. Research uncovered TWO different companies named "Consight":

1. **Consight Oy (Finland)** - Founded 2013 by Niilo Kemppainen, now defunct. This was a mobile construction app company.
2. **Consight (current, Los Angeles)** - The AI bid leveling platform. Founding information unclear.

According to Tracxn data, the current Consight lists:
- **Founder**: Niilo Kemppainen
- **CEO**: Miikka Viljanen

However, it's uncertain whether these are the SAME individuals from the Finnish company or different people with the same names, or if the data sources are conflating the two companies.

| Name | Role | Background |
|------|------|------------|
| Niilo Kemppainen | Founder (unconfirmed) | Possibly same person who founded Consight Oy (Finland) in 2013. Original Niilo held M.Sc. in Construction Management and was a lecturer for construction supervisors. |
| Miikka Viljanen | CEO (unconfirmed) | Possibly same person who was CEO of Consight Oy. Original Miikka had background from The Housing Finance and Development Centre of Finland, with M.A. in Theology and experience in project management. |

**Research Gap**: The exact founding team of the current Consight.ai (Los Angeles) needs verification. LinkedIn searches did not return clear profiles for current Consight leadership.

### Executive Team
No executive team members publicly identified beyond potential founder/CEO.

### Board Members & Advisors
None publicly disclosed.

### Team Size
- **Current employees**: Unknown (estimated <10 based on early stage)
- **Growth**: Version 1.0 launched September 2024, suggesting very early stage
- **Key locations**: Los Angeles, CA

**Evidence from LinkedIn**: A former software engineer (Milos Berka) worked on updating Consight's web application for construction site inspection, but this appears to be related to the Finnish Consight Oy, not the current AI bid leveling platform.

## Competitive Intelligence Summary

### Strengths
- **AI-first approach**: Purpose-built AI for bid leveling vs. bolt-on AI features in legacy platforms
- **Ease of use**: Works with existing PDF/Word bid formats, minimal subcontractor friction
- **Time savings claim**: 40 hours per project is compelling ROI if validated
- **Real-time collaboration**: Addresses version control pain point in Excel-based workflows
- **Speed**: Claims to complete bid tabs in 40 seconds vs. manual processes
- **Focused product**: Laser-focused on solving one specific pain point (bid leveling) rather than full-suite bloat

### Weaknesses
- **Very early stage**: Version 1.0 only launched September 2024
- **Unknown market traction**: No named customers, case studies, or third-party validation
- **Limited integrations**: No apparent integration with major construction platforms (Procore, Autodesk, etc.)
- **Small team**: Appears to be very small team, potential scalability concerns
- **Unproven technology**: AI accuracy claims not independently verified
- **Narrow use case**: Only addresses preconstruction bid leveling, not full estimating workflow
- **Pricing opacity**: No transparent pricing creates friction in sales process
- **Minimal brand presence**: Virtually no LinkedIn presence, press coverage, or thought leadership
- **Unclear founding story**: Conflicting information about founders/team creates credibility questions

### Opportunities (for us)
1. **Integration advantage**: If we can integrate with Procore, Autodesk, or other platforms, we have immediate differentiation
2. **Credibility gap**: Opportunity to establish case studies, ROI proof, and third-party validation while they're still building credibility
3. **Feature expansion**: Their narrow focus on bid leveling creates opening for more comprehensive estimating solution
4. **Market education**: They're still in early market education phase - opportunity to establish category leadership
5. **Enterprise customers**: Their team-size pricing suggests they may struggle with large enterprise GCs - potential white space
6. **Geographic expansion**: Based in LA with unknown geographic reach - opportunities in other markets
7. **Customer support**: Small team likely means limited support capacity - opportunity to differentiate on service

### Threats
- **AI innovation pace**: As AI-native company, they may iterate faster than legacy competitors adapting AI
- **Niche dominance**: Could become the "best in breed" for bid leveling, forcing integrations from larger platforms
- **User experience**: If their drag-and-drop UX is genuinely better, could create switching momentum
- **Pricing flexibility**: As small company, can likely undercut enterprise pricing from Procore, ConstructConnect
- **Acquisition target**: Could be attractive acquisition for Autodesk, Procore, or ConstructConnect to add AI capabilities
- **Venture backing**: If they raise significant funding, could rapidly scale go-to-market and product development

### Overall Competitive Assessment
**Threat Level**: LOW to MEDIUM (currently)

Consight appears to be a very early-stage startup (Version 1.0 in September 2024) with limited market presence, unclear funding, and no publicly verified customer traction. However, their AI-first approach to a real pain point (bid leveling) and compelling value proposition (40 hours saved per project) could gain momentum if they execute well.

**Key areas to monitor**:
1. Funding announcements (seed/Series A would signal acceleration)
2. Named customer case studies (would validate product-market fit)
3. Integration partnerships (especially with Procore, Autodesk)
4. Team expansion (especially sales/marketing leadership hires)
5. Geographic expansion beyond California market
6. Product expansion beyond bid leveling into broader estimating

**Competitive Response Recommendations**:
1. **Track their positioning**: Monitor how they message against us (if at all)
2. **Test their product**: Get demo/trial to understand actual UX and AI capabilities
3. **Develop integration strategy**: If they gain traction, consider integration vs. build competing feature
4. **Case study focus**: Differentiate through proven customer success stories while they lack validation
5. **Enterprise strategy**: Focus on large GC accounts where their small team likely can't support

## Appendix: Company Name Confusion

During research, I identified at least THREE entities with similar names:

1. **Consight (current) - home.consight.ai**
   - AI bid leveling software
   - Los Angeles, CA
   - Active as of 2025
   - Focus: Preconstruction/estimating for general contractors

2. **Consight Oy - Finland**
   - Mobile construction field management app
   - Founded 2013 by Niilo Kemppainen
   - CEO: Miikka Viljanen (joined 2016)
   - Status: Deadpooled/defunct
   - Focus: Mobile apps for error observations, inspections, security measurements

3. **Consight Marketing Group, LLC**
   - B2B market research firm
   - Founded 2015 by Alan Hale
   - Based in Illinois
   - 2-10 employees
   - Completely different industry (market research, not construction tech)

**It is UNCLEAR** whether the current Consight.ai is:
- A relaunch/pivot by the same Finnish team
- A completely unrelated company that happens to use the same name
- An acquisition of the Finnish company's IP/brand

This ambiguity creates credibility concerns and should be clarified before making competitive assessments.
