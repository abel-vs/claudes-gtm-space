# Nonlinear - Comprehensive Competitor Research Report

---

## Company Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Company Name** | Nonlinear |
| **Website** | https://www.nonlinear.build/ |
| **LinkedIn** | https://in.linkedin.com/company/nonlinear |
| **Founded** | 2023 |
| **Headquarters** | San Francisco, CA |
| **Industry** | Construction Technology (AEC - Architecture, Engineering, Construction) |
| **Business Model** | B2B SaaS - AI Workflow Automation Platform |

### What They Do

Nonlinear is an AI-first construction technology startup that provides a no-code workflow automation platform for AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) firms. The platform enables firms to design, deploy, and reuse AI-powered workflows across projects, teams, and offices to automate repetitive, document-heavy tasks and reduce project costs.

### Mission/Vision

"AI in construction doesn't fail because the models aren't powerful, it fails because teams don't know how to use them consistently. With Nonlinear, we take the guesswork out and enable teams to package prompts, tribal knowledge, and proprietary data into workflows that can actually be reused." - Sheel Sansare, CEO

Their goal is to solve one of the construction sector's most persistent problems: the inefficiency caused by disjointed systems and manual document management.
