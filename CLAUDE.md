# Claude Code Instructions

## On Session Start

Always first check MEMORY.md at the start of each session to review past errors, learnings, and workarounds to prevent repeating mistakes.

## Project Context

This is a GTM (Go-To-Market) workspace for managing sales outreach, contact research, and CRM operations using Attio and Linear integrations.

## Updating Memory

Whenever you encounter an issue that should be remembered for future sessions, add it to MEMORY.md. This includes:

- **API errors and workarounds** - e.g., Attio MCP tools that fail and alternative approaches
- **Field mappings** - correct slugs, field names, or data structures
- **Tool limitations** - things that don't work as expected
- **Successful patterns** - approaches that work well and should be reused

Always document:
1. What the issue was
2. Why it happened (if known)
3. The workaround or solution

This ensures the next Claude Code session doesn't repeat the same mistakes.
