# Belidor - Competitive Intelligence Report

---

## Company Overview

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Company Name** | Belidor |
| **Website** | https://www.belidor.ai/ |
| **LinkedIn** | [Marc Anthony Apicella - CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcapicella/) |
| **Founded** | ~April 2025 (approximately 6 months old as of October 2025) |
| **Headquarters** | Paris, France (La Maison AI office) |
| **Industry** | Construction Technology / AI for Preconstruction |

### What They Do

Belidor is building the AI decision-making engine for U.S. preconstruction, starting with automated bid leveling for general contractors. Their flagship product uses AI to read any bid—no matter the format—pulling every line item, quantity, and cost into a clean table in seconds, helping construction teams compare bids apples-to-apples 100x faster than manual processes.

From AI extraction to spreadsheet-level control, Belidor gives users everything they need to compare, refine, and award bids with confidence. The software aligns scopes, flags gaps, and highlights best-value options automatically, with every number linking back to its source page with a confidence score for auditing.

### Mission/Vision

Belidor's mission is to accelerate the rate of construction and design 100x by creating the user-friendly intelligence layer for the built world. They focus on preconstruction: transforming messy documents into data that is easy to read, analyze, and understand to compound learning from past projects so preconstruction teams bid faster and win more.

Long-term vision: Belidor aims to become the intelligence layer for the entire built world. Upstream, they want to optimize architectural designs for constructability and cost. Downstream, they envision intelligent procurement that automatically orders materials at optimal prices and lead times. The end state: "We need a hospital" becomes a complete design, accurate pricing, qualified subcontractors, ordered materials, and an executable schedule within days or weeks, not months or years.

### Company Name Origin

The company is named after Bernard Forest de Bélidor (1698-1761), the 18th-century French engineer who helped transform engineering from art into science. Bélidor was a military and civil engineer who developed the science of hydraulics and ballistics, publishing influential textbooks including "La science des ingénieurs" and "Architecture hydraulique" that remained influential until the early 19th century.
